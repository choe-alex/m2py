    "The calculations of loss during the training of networks can use weighting to reinforce the learning of specific variables and features in data. In order to reinforce physically reasonable predictions, you can impose more strict penalties for predictions in physically invalid predictions. For example, a prediction of Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) above the Schockley-Quassier predicted maximum PCE could increase exponentially, rather than linearly.\n",
